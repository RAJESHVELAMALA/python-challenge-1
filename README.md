# Ordering System

Ordering System is a project that provides the following functionality
- Menu comprises of multiple categories (like Snacks, Meals, Drinks Etc ) , Items and Cost of item.
- Option for users to order an item and required quantity
- User can order multiple items
- Order is stored and finally presented with the itemized and total cost of the order.

## Design Considerations

- Prompt User Inputs for allowing user to select the items and quantity
- Proper Validations to ensure valid user inputs are captured, Inform the user and allow the user to re-enter in case of validation failures.
- Used dictories,lists, Loops (For and While), and Format Printing to complete the project
